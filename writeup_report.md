**Behavioral Cloning Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

## Rubric Points
###Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/432/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

###Files Submitted & Code Quality

####1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode

My project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network 
* writeup_report.md summarizing the results

####2. Submission includes functional code
Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing 
```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

####3. Submission code is usable and readable

The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.

For modularity and test purpose, I wrote 3 functions to generate the model, which are:
* `model\_simplest`: simplest model to show the workflow
* `model\_LeNet`: LeNet model
* `model\_nvidia`: the model in [nvidia's paper](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/). This is the model I used in the final report.

###Model Architecture and Training Strategy

####1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed

The model used in the report is generated in function `model\_nvidia` (line 91). The input to the model is the 320x160 RGB image generated by the center camera. The model consists of the following layers:
1 Normalization
2 Crop the top 70 pixel and bottom 25 pixel
3 2D Convolution with 5x5 kernel, 2x2 stride and depth 24, RELU activation, Dropout
4 2D Convolution with 5x5 kernel, 2x2 stride and depth 36, RELU activation, Dropout
5 2D Convolution with 5x5 kernel, 2x2 stride and depth 48, RELU activation, Dropout
6 2D Convolution with 3x3 kernel, depth 64, RELU activation
7 Fully connected layer with output size 100, RELU activation
8 Fully connected layer with output size 50, RELU activation
9 Fully connected layer with output size 10, RELU activation
10 Fully connected layer with output size 1

Here is a visualization of the architecture (note: visualizing the architecture is optional according to the project rubric)

####2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model

The model contains dropout layers, with dropout probabillity 0.2, in order to reduce overfitting. 

The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (the parameter `validation\_split=0.3` and `shuffle=True`). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.

Also, I need to tune the number of epoches `nb\_epoch` to make sure it doesn't over fit.

####3. Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually. The main hyper parameter I need to tune is `nb\_epoch`. The final number of epoch I chose is 5.

####4. Data Collection and Augmentation

The lengthy code line 17-49 is how I augmented the data. For each line in the CSV file, I added:
1. The center image, and the steering\_angle
2. The left image, and the steering\_angle + 0.1
3. The right image, and the steering\_angle - 0.3
4. The above 3 sets of data with flipped image and sign. This step artifically generate data for a reverse direction.

During data collection, I drove the car manually in both directions for 1 cycle. I was mainly driving in the center, with a few unintentionally recovery from the edge.

My data collection gaves me 1993 lines of csv file, which means after augmentation, my training + validation data set is 1993x6=11958.
